A prison is composed of a `n` x `m` matrix of steel bars.

You'll receive as input:
* `h`, an array containing the horizontal indices of the bars that have been removed
* `v`, an array containing the vertical indices of the bars that have been removed

compute the area of the biggest `hole` in the prison.
